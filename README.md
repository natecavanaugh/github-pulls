## Building locally

This branch has changed to using Electron and Redux with React (using the [Electon React Boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) setup).

To build locally, follow the following steps:

1. Run `npm install` from the root of the project
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Make your changes, and the app will update live

We use [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to build the packages and installers for the different operating systems, and use [electron-gh-releases](https://github.com/jenslind/electron-gh-releases) to handle notifying users of an update.
